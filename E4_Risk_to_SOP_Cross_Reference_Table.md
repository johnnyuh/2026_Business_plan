# Appendix E4 — Risk → SOP Cross-Reference Table

## Purpose
This table maps **identified business risks** to the **specific SOPs and governance mechanisms** that mitigate them. It ensures risk is managed proactively through process and cadence—not awareness alone.

This is a **risk control map**, not a risk register.

---

## How This Table Is Used

- Referenced during:
  - Monthly Financial Reviews (C7)
  - Quarterly Growth Reviews (A6)
  - Risk or disruption events
- Used to diagnose failures by tracing risk exposure back to SOP gaps
- Supports audit and governance clarity

---

## Core Risk Categories

Risks are grouped into five canonical categories:
1. Market Risk
2. Capacity Risk
3. Client Experience Risk
4. Operational / Execution Risk
5. Governance Risk

## Risk → SOP Mapping

### 1. Market Risk

| Risk | Description | Mitigating SOPs / Artifacts |
|----|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Rapid market shifts | Sudden changes in leverage or pricing behavior | B2 (Market→Funnel Map), C7 (Monthly Financial Review), E3 (Scenario Ranges) |
| Misinformation influence | Clients reacting to headlines or media | C2 (Consultation SOP), D1 (Lifecycle Map), B6 (Anchor Content) |
| Submarket divergence | Neighborhood-level inconsistency | B2 (Market Alignment), B1 (Funnels), D1 (Experience Map) |

---

### 2. Capacity Risk

| Risk | Description | Mitigating SOPs / Artifacts |
|----|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Solo-operator overload | Volume exceeds sustainable capacity | A5 (Capacity Model), C3 (Daily Schedule), C4 (Weekly Checklist) |
| Burnout | Recovery erosion over time | A4 (Pause Reasons), C5 (Daily Scorecard), C6 (Weekly Review) |
| Cognitive fatigue | Decision quality degradation | A5 (Capacity Model), A3 (Growth Gates) |

---

### 3. Client Experience Risk

| Risk | Description | Mitigating SOPs / Artifacts |
|----|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Expectation misalignment | Late-stage surprises | D1 (Lifecycle Map), D2 (Touchpoint→SOP), C2 (Consultation SOP) |
| Communication breakdown | Client anxiety or frustration | C2 (Client Communication SOP), D3 (Failure Modes) |
| Experience compression | Rushed advisory delivery | A4 (Pause Conditions), A5 (Capacity Model) |

---

### 4. Operational / Execution Risk

| Risk | Description | Mitigating SOPs / Artifacts |
|----|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Process drift | Skipped or inconsistent steps | C2 (SOPs), C1 (SOP Map), C6 (Weekly Review) |
| Documentation gaps | Compliance or audit exposure | C2 (File Management SOP), C5 (Daily Scorecard) |
| Error escalation | Rework and client friction | C2 (Transaction SOP), D3 (Failure Modes) |

---

### 5. Governance Risk

| Risk | Description | Mitigating SOPs / Artifacts |
|----|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Unchecked growth | Volume without oversight | A2 (Growth Framework), A3 (Growth Gates), A6 (Quarterly Review) |
| Reactive decision-making | Emotion-driven changes | A4 (Pause Reasons), E3 (Scenario Ranges) |
| Drift from constraints | Erosion of non-goals | Section 9 (Constraints), A3 (Growth Gates) |

---

## Escalation Rules

- If a risk manifests twice in a quarter:
  - Trace to governing SOP
  - Review adequacy and adherence
  - Adjust scope or cadence if needed
- Repeated risk exposure triggers governance review

---

## Governance Notes

- Risks are managed through **structure and cadence**
- Awareness without process change is insufficient
- SOP adherence is the primary mitigation mechanism

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If a risk materializes,  
**process discipline increases before tactics change**.
