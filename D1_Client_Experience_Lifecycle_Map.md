# Appendix D1 — Client Experience Lifecycle Map

## Purpose
This map defines the **end-to-end client experience lifecycle** for both buyers and sellers. It ensures consistency, expectation alignment, and trust preservation across all touchpoints—from first awareness through post-close relationship management.

This is a **governance map**, not a script.

## Lifecycle Overview (Canonical)

1. Awareness & First Impression  
2. Engagement & Qualification  
3. Consultation & Alignment  
4. Active Representation  
5. Transaction Execution  
6. Closing & Transition  
7. Post-Transaction Relationship

Each stage has a distinct objective, risk profile, and governance emphasis.
