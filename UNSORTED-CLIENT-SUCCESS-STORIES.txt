Client SUCCESS STORIES

1. My eye-for-detail and knowledge of home construction has quickly gained me trust with buyers when showing them homes. Influence of my designer background to lead me to success in real estate.

2. My first foray into a foreclosed property came to me as a surprise, but through lots of persistence and positivity and fighting I got my client off the hook. Even the lenders that I worked with (the ones that my client owed money to) told me that they were impressed with my performance and getting the job done for my client. An example of leading a team with many moving parts towards success.
