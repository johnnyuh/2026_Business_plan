# Appendix B6 — YouTube Anchor Video Framework

## Purpose
This framework defines how **long-form YouTube videos function as anchor assets** within the marketing system. Anchor videos establish authority, clarify market reality, and feed all downstream content—without creating unsustainable production pressure.

This is a **strategy and reuse framework**, not a publishing schedule.

---

## Governing Principles

- Fewer, higher-quality anchor videos
- Education and interpretation over prediction
- Calm authority over urgency or hype
- Repurposing over net-new creation
- Consultation readiness over views

Anchor videos exist to **support decisions**, not chase algorithms.

---

## Role of YouTube in the System

YouTube serves as:
- The **primary long-form education channel**
- The source material for short-form content (Reels, TikTok, Shorts)
- A credibility reference point for buyers and sellers

YouTube does **not** function as:
- A daily content platform
- A trend-driven channel
- A volume or growth KPI

---

## Anchor Video Categories

Anchor videos fall into **four approved categories**.

---

### 1. Buyer Strategy Anchors

**Objective**
Increase buyer consultation readiness by clarifying leverage, risk, and opportunity.

**Examples**
- “How buyers actually win in a transitional market”
- “What most buyers misunderstand about leverage”

**Primary Funnel**
Buyer Funnel

---

### 2. Seller Strategy Anchors

**Objective**
Align seller expectations and establish pricing realism.

**Examples**
- “Why pricing strategy matters more than marketing”
- “The hidden cost of overpricing in today’s market”

**Primary Funnel**
Seller Funnel

---

### 3. Market Interpretation Anchors

**Objective**
Provide calm, nuanced interpretation of current conditions.

**Examples**
- “What inventory is really telling us right now”
- “Why headlines don’t match neighborhood reality”

**Primary Funnel**
Cross-funnel (Buyer & Seller)

---

### 4. Advisory & Process Anchors

**Objective**
Differentiate advisory approach and professionalism.

**Examples**
- “What a real real-estate consultation should feel like”
- “How I help clients decide when *not* to move”

**Primary Funnel**
Cross-funnel

---

## Video Structure (Recommended)

Each anchor video should follow a consistent structure:

1. **Context framing**
   - What question or confusion exists
2. **Reality clarification**
   - What the market is actually doing
3. **Decision implications**
   - What this means for buyers or sellers
4. **Advisory guidance**
   - How to think, not what to do
5. **Soft close**
   - Invitation to a conversation, not a CTA push

---

## Length & Frequency Guidelines

- **Length:** 8–20 minutes (flexible)
- **Frequency:** 1–2 per week maximum
- **No minimum requirement**
- Production is batch-based, not reactive

Missed uploads do not require catch-up.

---

## Repurposing Rules

Each anchor video may generate:
- 2–4 Instagram Reels
- 2–4 TikTok clips
- Optional YouTube Shorts
- Optional written summary (Substack or caption)

No repurposed content without an anchor source.

---

## CTA Guidelines

CTAs must be:
- Advisory
- Optional
- Calm

Acceptable examples:
- “If this applies to you, I’m happy to talk it through.”
- “Reach out if you want a second opinion.”

Unacceptable:
- Urgency framing
- Scarcity language
- Calls to “act now”

---

## KPI Focus (YouTube)

Primary indicators:
- Consultation quality influenced
- Viewer retention on educational segments
- Comments reflecting understanding

Explicitly excluded:
- Subscriber growth
- View counts
- Algorithmic optimization metrics

---

## Capacity Safeguards

Anchor video production must fit within:
- Monday content batching (C3)
- Weekly execution limits (C4)

If production begins to:
- Compress client service
- Crowd prospecting
- Erode recovery time  
frequency is reduced immediately.

---

## Review Cadence

- Monthly: Performance and reuse review
- Quarterly: Category balance and emphasis review
- Annual: Structural review only

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If YouTube content compromises **clarity, calm, or capacity**,  
production slows—authority is never rushed.
