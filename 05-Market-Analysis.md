# Neighborhood Categories That I Should Prioritize in 2026

Category 1: Upper-Middle Suburban Pockets With High Turnover
Price: $550k–$800k
Strong schools or strong commute
Established neighborhoods with predictable seasonal cycles

Category 2: Starter-to-Move-Up Hybrids
Price: $475k–$650k
Strong entry-level buyer funnel
Residents who move on after 3–7 years

Category 3: Select High-End Pockets for Brand Elevation (10–20% of your 2026 farm)
This is where Applewood, Bel-Aire fit:
Maintain presence
Position yourself as long-term trusted advisor
But do not rely on it for 2026 financial velocity



# Recommendation Summary

Primary Farms (70–80% of effort)
Mid to upper-middle neighborhoods ($475k–$800k)
High turnover
Solid velocity
Manageable competition
Life-stage-driven churn
My Primary Farms

Secondary Farm (20–30% of effort)
Select high-end pocket (e.g., Applewood or similar)
Long-term positioning
Brand gravity
But not responsible for 2026 revenue goals
My Secondary Farms

This balance gives me:
Transaction count
Reliable urgency
Strong GCI
Future brand growth in the luxury tier

# Optimal Size
1,200 - 1,800 Homes
