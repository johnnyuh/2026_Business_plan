# Neighborhood Categories That I Should Prioritize in 2026

Category 1: Upper-Middle Suburban Pockets With High Turnover
Price: $550k–$800k
Strong schools or strong commute
Established neighborhoods with predictable seasonal cycles

Category 2: Starter-to-Move-Up Hybrids
Price: $475k–$650k
Strong entry-level buyer funnel
Residents who move on after 3–7 years

Category 3: Select High-End Pockets for Brand Elevation (10–20% of your 2026 farm)
This is where Applewood fits:
Maintain presence
Position yourself as long-term trusted advisor
But do not rely on it for 2026 financial velocity

# How to Select Your Final 2026 Farm (Simple 3-Step Method)
Use this binary filter to quickly test each candidate neighborhood.

Step 1 — Performance Filter
Does the area meet all of these?
Turnover ≥ 6%
DOM ≤ 40
Median price $475k–$800k
If no → eliminate
If yes → move to Step 2

Step 2 — Density Filter
Does it have 800–1,500 homes total?
This is the optimal size for your marketing budget and expected return.
If fewer than 500 → too small
If more than 2,000 → break into micro-farms

Step 3 — Competitive Filter
Is there room to become a top-3 agent within 18 months through consistent marketing?
If yes → strong candidate
If no → deprioritize for 2026

# The Neighborhood Types You Should Avoid in 2026
Avoid areas with:
Median price > $1.2M
DOM > 60 days
Turnover < 3%
Highly irregular product (difficult comps)
Ultra-dominant legacy agents
Investor-heavy pockets with low owner-occupancy
These neighborhoods destroy urgency, limit transaction count, and undercut your financial goals.

# Recommendation Summary
For 2026, your farms should lean into:

Primary Farms (70–80% of effort)
Mid to upper-middle neighborhoods ($475k–$800k)
High turnover
Solid velocity
Manageable competition
Life-stage-driven churn

Secondary Farm (20–30% of effort)
Select high-end pocket (e.g., Applewood or similar)
Long-term positioning
Brand gravity
But not responsible for 2026 revenue goals

This balance gives you:
Transaction count
Reliable urgency
Strong GCI
Future brand growth in the luxury tier

# Optimal Size
1,200 - 1,800 Homes

# Optimal Price Range
$550k - $800k

Fusion 355 is not a farm, but a micro-farm that is not included with the other farm.
