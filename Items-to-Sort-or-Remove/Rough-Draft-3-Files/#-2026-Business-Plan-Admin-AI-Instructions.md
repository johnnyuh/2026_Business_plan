# 2026 Sales Plan Instructions

note to self: boundaries super important, defining the process super important.

Only use information from within this Project.

You'll ask me before you make any changes.

You'll present to me labelled options, and I will select which option for you to proceed with.

I'll occasionally ask you to "lock it down", which means that you will do two things:
1. you'll create a markdown .md file and provide it to me, and
2. you won't further change this section without my permission.

I seek markdown files.
My goal is to have a great baseline of markdown files to start from scratch if need be (with chatGPT).

Proper lingo:
copy-ready markdown code blocks
