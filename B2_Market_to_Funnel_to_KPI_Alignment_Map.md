# Appendix B2 — Market → Funnel → KPI Alignment Map

## Purpose
This appendix defines how **market conditions directly determine funnel focus and KPI priority**. It prevents generic optimization and ensures that effort is aligned with real-time market signals rather than static plans or vanity metrics.

This is an **interpretive alignment tool**, not a forecasting model.

---

## Core Alignment Principle

Market behavior dictates:
1. **Which funnel receives emphasis**
2. **Which decisions require support**
3. **Which KPIs matter most**

Funnel focus is adjusted based on observed conditions, not assumptions.

---

## Market Condition Categories

The business interprets market conditions across three primary states.

---

### Market State 1 — Buyer-Leverage Market

**Observed Signals**
- Elevated inventory
- Increased seller concessions
- Price reductions becoming common
- Longer days on market

**Primary Funnel Focus**
- **Buyer Funnel**

**Strategic Objective**
- Educate buyers on leverage and opportunity
- Reduce fear-driven hesitation
- Frame disciplined action

**Priority KPIs**
- Qualified buyer consultations
- Consultation-to-agreement conversion
- Offer acceptance rate

**De-Emphasized Metrics**
- Listing intake volume
- Social reach or impressions

---

### Market State 2 — Seller-Leverage Market

**Observed Signals**
- Inventory compression
- Competitive bidding
- Rapid absorption
- Limited buyer leverage

**Primary Funnel Focus**
- **Seller Funnel**

**Strategic Objective**
- Secure listing inventory
- Frame pricing and timing advantage
- Manage buyer expectations proactively

**Priority KPIs**
- Listing consultations
- Listing-to-close conversion
- Price-to-list ratio

**De-Emphasized Metrics**
- Buyer inquiry volume
- Content output frequency

---

### Market State 3 — Transitional / Fragmented Market

**Observed Signals**
- Mixed pricing behavior
- Submarket divergence
- Uneven absorption rates
- Conflicting media narratives

**Primary Funnel Focus**
- **Balanced Buyer and Seller Funnels**
- **Geographic / Local Presence Funnel** elevated

**Strategic Objective**
- Interpret nuance
- Provide clarity amid uncertainty
- Build trust through realism

**Priority KPIs**
- Consultation quality
- Referral rate
- Repeat engagement

**De-Emphasized Metrics**
- Predictive market calls
- Broad-scope marketing pushes

---

## Funnel Adjustment Rules

- Funnel emphasis may shift **quarterly**, not weekly
- Changes are made during **governed reviews**, not reactively
- Only one primary funnel is emphasized at a time
- Geographic / Local Presence Funnel remains persistent but elastic

---

## KPI Governance Rules

- KPIs must:
  - Reflect decision quality
  - Indicate experience integrity
  - Be actionable by a solo operator

- KPIs may change in priority but **not in definition** without review

---

## Anti-Pattern Safeguards

This map explicitly prevents:
- Optimizing for engagement during low-intent markets
- Pushing sellers when buyer leverage dominates
- Scaling content output when conversion quality degrades
- Treating KPIs as static targets

---

## Review Cadence

- Market state assessed **monthly**
- Funnel emphasis reviewed **quarterly**
- KPI priority validated during Growth Reviews

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

When market conditions change, **funnel focus adjusts**—  
not effort intensity, not quality standards, and not governance discipline.
