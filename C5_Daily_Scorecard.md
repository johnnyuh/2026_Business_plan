# Appendix C5 — Daily Scorecard

## Purpose
The Daily Scorecard provides a **simple, objective snapshot** of execution quality, capacity health, and forward readiness. It is designed to surface issues early, prevent silent backlog, and support governance decisions—not to track volume or activity for its own sake.

This scorecard is completed **daily**, in under five minutes.

---

## How This Scorecard Is Used

- Completed during the **Daily Ops Review** (see C3)
- Reviewed informally day-to-day
- Patterns reviewed weekly (C4) and monthly
- Used as an **early warning signal**, not a performance evaluation
