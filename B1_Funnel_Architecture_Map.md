# Appendix B1 — Funnel Architecture Map

## Purpose
This appendix defines the **canonical funnel architecture** for the business. It establishes how leads enter, qualify, convert, and are governed across Buyer, Seller, and Geographic/Local Presence funnels.

These funnels are **strategic systems**, not marketing tactics. All lead generation, content, and outreach must map to one of these funnels to be considered valid.

---

## Governing Principles

- Fewer funnels, executed well
- Qualification before conversion
- Advisory positioning over urgency
- Capacity and experience integrity over volume
- Governance over optimization drift

Any activity that does not map cleanly to a funnel is excluded.

## Funnel 1 — Buyer Funnel

### Strategic Objective
Convert education-driven interest into **qualified buyer consultations** with minimal emotional overreach and maximum decision clarity.

### Primary Entry Points
- YouTube anchor videos (buyer strategy, market education)
- Instagram Reels and Feed (buyer opportunity framing)
- Apartment-community and hyperlocal relationship-based outreach
- Referral introductions

### Qualification Logic
A buyer is considered qualified when they demonstrate:
- Engagement with educational content or conversation
- Willingness to participate in a structured consultation
- Alignment with advisory-first expectations

### Trust-Building Mechanisms
- Market myth correction
- Transparent discussion of leverage and trade-offs
- Clear explanation of decision frameworks and process

### Conversion Moment
- Formal Buyer Consultation

### Post-Conversion Path
- SOP-governed advisory process
- Negotiation and execution discipline
- Ongoing expectation management through close

---

## Funnel 2 — Seller Funnel

### Strategic Objective
Convert market curiosity and concern into **realistically aligned listing consultations** grounded in pricing discipline and process clarity.

### Primary Entry Points
- Market intelligence content (pricing, inventory, leverage)
- Seller-focused YouTube anchors
- Farm-based prospecting and neighborhood presence
- Past-client and referral reactivation

### Qualification Logic
A seller is considered qualified when they demonstrate:
- Motivation clarity
- Openness to market realities
- Willingness to engage in process-driven execution

### Trust-Building Mechanisms
- Data-backed pricing logic
- Clear articulation of risks, timelines, and decisions
- Expectation framing before commitment

### Conversion Moment
- Listing Consultation

### Post-Conversion Path
- Standardized listing execution
- Pricing and market feedback governance
- Client communication cadence through close

---

## Funnel 3 — Geographic / Local Presence Funnel

### Strategic Objective
Build **long-term familiarity and trust** within defined geographic areas that convert gradually into buyer or seller consultations.

### Primary Entry Points
- Neighborhood-specific content and insights
- Street-level presence (walking farms, local businesses)
- Physical marketing with QR entry points
- Consistent visibility in apartment and neighborhood spaces

### Engagement Mechanisms
- Hyperlocal observations
- Market context without solicitation pressure
- Repeated, low-friction exposure

### Conversion Logic
- Soft inquiry → advisory conversation → formal consultation (when appropriate)

### Post-Conversion Path
- Routed into Buyer or Seller Funnel as applicable

## Funnel Governance Rules

- **Single-Funnel Rule:** Every activity must map to one primary funnel.
- **Quarterly Optimization Only:** Funnel changes occur only during Quarterly Reviews.
- **Pause Authority:** Capacity or experience strain pauses intake immediately.
- **Sunset Authority:** Funnels that no longer align with strategy are retired.

---

## Funnel Success Definition

Success is measured by:
- Qualified consultations
- Conversion quality
- Experience integrity
- Sustainability within solo-operator capacity

Vanity metrics (reach, followers, impressions) are explicitly excluded.

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If a funnel increases volume at the expense of **clarity, calm, or client trust**,  
the funnel is misconfigured and must be corrected or paused.
