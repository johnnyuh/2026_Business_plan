# Appendix E3 — Scenario Range Table (Qualitative)

## Purpose
This appendix defines **qualitative operating scenarios** used to guide judgment, governance, and restraint across varying market and workload conditions. It prevents overreaction to short-term swings and anchors decisions in **range-based thinking**, not point forecasts.

This is a **decision context tool**, not a projection model.

---

## Scenario Design Principles

- Scenarios are **qualitative by design**
- They describe *conditions*, not targets
- No numeric thresholds are embedded
- Actions are governed by capacity and experience signals
- Scenarios inform posture, not predictions

---

## Canonical Operating Scenarios

The business evaluates conditions across **three primary scenarios**.

---

## Scenario 1 — Constrained / Defensive Range

### Defining Conditions
- Market uncertainty or volatility
- Inconsistent inquiry quality
- Slower decision cycles
- Elevated client anxiety

### Primary Risks
- Overworking weak opportunities
- Compressing advisory depth to “create momentum”
- Emotional and cognitive drain

### Governance Posture
- Narrow funnel focus
- Conservative intake
- Slower decision pacing

### Approved Actions
- Emphasize education and clarity
- Strengthen qualification standards
- Protect recovery and capacity

### Prohibited Actions
- Expanding scope
- Increasing content volume reactively
- Chasing marginal leads

---

## Scenario 2 — Stable / Baseline Range

### Defining Conditions
- Predictable inquiry flow
- Balanced buyer and seller activity
- Manageable workload
- Stable personal capacity

### Primary Risks
- Complacency
- Minor process drift
- Quiet capacity creep

### Governance Posture
- Maintain current operating model
- Execute SOPs consistently
- Observe patterns, not anomalies

### Approved Actions
- Continue governed cadence
- Incremental process refinement
- Maintain funnel alignment

### Prohibited Actions
- Premature growth
- Optimization without review
- Ignoring early warning signals

---

## Scenario 3 — Opportunity / Stretch Range

### Defining Conditions
- Strong inquiry quality
- Favorable market leverage
- High consultation-to-close alignment
- Elevated workload pressure

### Primary Risks
- Overextension
- Experience compression
- Decision fatigue

### Governance Posture
- Heightened review frequency
- Conservative growth consideration
- Reversibility emphasis

### Approved Actions
- Consider single-axis growth (via A3/A6)
- Tighten intake standards
- Increase buffer protection

### Prohibited Actions
- Multi-axis growth
- Delegation without governance
- Sacrificing recovery time

---

## Scenario Transition Rules

- Scenarios are **observed**, not declared
- Movement between ranges is gradual
- Governance responses lag signals intentionally
- No reactive switching based on single weeks or deals

---

## Review Cadence

- Scenario posture assessed **monthly**
- Interpreted during Quarterly Reviews
- Used to contextualize financial and capacity signals

---

## Governance Integration

Scenario posture informs:
- Funnel emphasis (B2)
- Growth eligibility (A3/A6)
- Capacity response (A5)
- Experience protection (D1–D4)

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If conditions feel ambiguous,  
operate as if in the **Constrained / Defensive Range** until clarity returns.
