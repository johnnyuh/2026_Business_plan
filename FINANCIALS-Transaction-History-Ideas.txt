TRANSACTION HISTORY

2025 was not a high-volume year for my real estate business, I was dealing with personal issues.

2024 was so-so, also dealing with personal issues.

But, 2023 was great, but I don't have the CSV files. I made just over $100k take home, I met all of my brokerage 'cap' goals, and it was the first year that my real estate career started to 'click'. 

2022 was slow, my first year. 

So generally, for 2026 I expect to build on my 2023 successes. I am confident I can quickly get back to the success I began to experience in 2023.

What worked for me was repeat business, door hangers led to business 3 times, referral biz, my sphere, and past working acquaintances.
