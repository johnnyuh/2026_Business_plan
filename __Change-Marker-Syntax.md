# Change Marker Syntax

## 1. Change Marker Syntax (Canonical)
Use inline markers directly in the file where the change occurs.
### Preferred format
[CHANGE — YYYY-MM-DD | Reason | Your initials]
### Example:
[CHANGE — 2025-12-18 | Tightened language around capacity signals | JU]
Place the marker immediately above the modified paragraph, table, or section.

## 2. Scope Tags (Required)
Add one scope tag inside the marker so intent is clear.
### Tag Meaning
LANGUAGE	Wording only, no logic change
LOGIC	Decision rules or constraints changed
STRUCTURE	Reordered sections, tables, or flow
ADD	Net-new content
REMOVE	Content removed
### Example:
[CHANGE — 2025-12-18 | LOGIC | Adjusted pause trigger threshold | JU]

---

## 3. Single-File Change Log (One per file)
At the very bottom of each appendix or section file, maintain a minimal log.
### Example:
---
## Change Log
- 2025-12-18 — LOGIC — Capacity trigger clarified (JU)
- 2025-12-12 — LANGUAGE — Tone tightened (JU)
