# Appendix B3 — Content Command Center

## Purpose
The Content Command Center is the **single operational control point** for all content activity across platforms. It ensures that content supports funnel strategy, preserves advisory positioning, and remains executable within solo-operator capacity.

This is a **governance and execution system**, not a creative backlog.

---

## Core Principles

- One strategy → many outputs
- Batching over daily production
- Repurposing over net-new creation
- Quality and clarity over frequency
- Funnel alignment over platform trends

Any content that does not map to a funnel or calendar is excluded.

---

## Content Hierarchy

All content flows downstream from **anchor assets**.

### Tier 1 — Anchor Content
High-leverage, long-form assets that define the message.

Examples:
- YouTube strategy videos
- Market interpretation videos
- Buyer or seller deep-dive explanations

**Rules**
- Produced in batches
- Limited in quantity
- Designed for reuse

---

### Tier 2 — Derivative Content
Short-form outputs derived from anchors.

Examples:
- Instagram Reels
- TikTok clips
- Short market insights
- Quote or insight graphics

**Rules**
- Must reference a Tier 1 asset or ongoing theme
- No standalone ideation without anchor alignment

---

### Tier 3 — Nurture & Presence Content
Low-pressure, trust-building touchpoints.

Examples:
- Market pulse updates
- Local observations
- Clarifying commentary
- Process transparency posts

**Rules**
- No urgency framing
- No CTA pressure
- Supports familiarity, not conversion

---

## Funnel Mapping

Each content item must map to **one primary funnel**:

- Buyer Funnel
- Seller Funnel
- Geographic / Local Presence Funnel

Dual-purpose content is permitted only if one funnel is clearly primary.

---

## Production Workflow

### Weekly Cadence
- Content planning occurs weekly
- Production batched on designated marketing days
- Scheduling completed in advance

### Monthly Cadence
- Review performance at the funnel level
- Retire underperforming formats
- No mid-cycle platform additions

---

## Platform Governance

### Approved Platforms
- YouTube (anchor content)
- Instagram (distribution + nurture)
- TikTok (repurposed short-form only)
- Substack (optional, long-form clarification)

### Platform Rules
- No daily posting requirements
- No trend-chasing
- No platform expansion without review

---

## KPI Focus (Content)

Content is evaluated by:
- Qualified consultations influenced
- Consultation readiness
- Engagement quality (comments, saves)

Explicitly excluded:
- Follower count
- Impressions
- Virality metrics

---

## Capacity Safeguards

- Content creation must fit within:
  - C3 (Daily Tactical Schedule)
  - C4 (Weekly Tactical Checklist)
- Any sustained overrun triggers:
  - Content reduction
  - Format simplification
  - Growth pause if unresolved

---

## Review & Governance

- Content performance reviewed monthly
- Structural changes reviewed quarterly
- Deviations documented

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If content creation competes with **client experience or decision quality**,  
content volume is reduced immediately.
