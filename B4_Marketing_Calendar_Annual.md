# Appendix B4 — Marketing Calendar (Annual)

## Purpose
This calendar governs **what is published, when, where, and why** across the year. It enforces focus, batching, and repurposing to protect solo-operator capacity while supporting the canonical funnels.

This is a **governance document**, not a posting checklist.

---

## Governing Principles

- Weekly themes, not daily pressure
- Repurpose-first content creation
- Funnel alignment over platform optimization
- Capacity protection over consistency theater
- No trend or platform chasing

Any activity outside this calendar requires review.

## Production & Batching

- **Primary production day:** Monday (see C3)

---

## Capacity Safeguards

- If content creation interferes with:
  - Client service
  - Prospecting execution
  - Recovery time  
  content volume is reduced immediately.

- Any sustained overload triggers review during Monthly Governance.

---

## Review Cadence

- Monthly: Content effectiveness review (funnel level)
- Quarterly: Theme emphasis review (market-aligned)
- Annual: Structural review only

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Content exists to **support consultations and trust**,  
not to satisfy algorithms or appearance of activity.
