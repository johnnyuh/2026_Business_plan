# Appendix D3 — Client Experience Failure Modes Table

## Purpose
This table identifies **predictable client experience failure modes**, their early warning signals, root causes, and corrective actions. It exists to prevent repeat failures by treating experience breakdowns as **system-level issues**, not situational mistakes.

This is a **diagnostic and prevention tool**, not a reactive checklist.

---

## How This Table Is Used

- Referenced when client friction occurs
- Reviewed during Weekly Reviews (C6)
- Formally reviewed during Quarterly Experience Reviews (D4)
- Used to inform SOP and capacity adjustments

---

## Failure Mode Categories

Experience failures tend to cluster in five categories:
1. Expectation Misalignment
2. Communication Breakdown
3. Process Drift
4. Capacity Compression
5. Emotional Escalation

## Failure Modes Table

### 1. Expectation Misalignment

| Element | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Failure Mode | Client expectations diverge from market or process reality |
| Early Signals | Repeated clarification questions, resistance to guidance |
| Root Causes | Inadequate consultation framing, rushed intake |
| Corrective Action | Re-run expectation-setting SOP; slow intake |
| Prevention | Stronger early-stage alignment (D1, C2) |

---

### 2. Communication Breakdown

| Element | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Failure Mode | Client feels uninformed or surprised |
| Early Signals | Increased inbound pings, anxiety questions |
| Root Causes | Missed cadence, reactive updates |
| Corrective Action | Re-establish communication cadence immediately |
| Prevention | Proactive communication SOP adherence |

---

### 3. Process Drift

| Element | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Failure Mode | Execution becomes inconsistent or error-prone |
| Early Signals | Missed steps, increased rework |
| Root Causes | SOP shortcuts, overload |
| Corrective Action | Pause intake; re-stabilize SOPs |
| Prevention | Capacity governance (A5), SOP reviews |

---

### 4. Capacity Compression

| Element | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Failure Mode | Volume overwhelms advisory quality |
| Early Signals | Rushed conversations, shortened explanations |
| Root Causes | Growth without gates, schedule spillover |
| Corrective Action | Immediate growth pause (A4) |
| Prevention | Growth Gates (A3), capacity checks |

---

### 5. Emotional Escalation

| Element | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Failure Mode | Client stress escalates into conflict |
| Early Signals | Heightened tone, defensiveness |
| Root Causes | Delayed framing, unmanaged expectations |
| Corrective Action | Slow down; reframe decisions calmly |
| Prevention | Emotional capacity awareness (A5) |

---

## Escalation & Review Rules

- Any failure mode observed twice in a quarter triggers:
  - SOP review
  - Capacity review
  - Experience review (D4)
- Patterns matter more than isolated incidents

---

## Governance Notes

- Failures are signals, not personal shortcomings
- Corrections target systems, not clients
- Documentation is required for recurring issues

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If the same experience failure repeats,  
the system must change—**not the client**.
