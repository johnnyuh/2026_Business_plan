# Appendix C2 — Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

## Purpose
This appendix defines the **core operating procedures** that govern repeatable work across marketing, prospecting, client experience, transactions, and governance. SOPs exist to **reduce cognitive load, prevent errors, and preserve advisory quality**—not to eliminate professional judgment.

All SOPs are subordinate to strategic constraints and capacity governance.
