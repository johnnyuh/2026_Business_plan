# Appendix E2 — Financial KPI → Funnel Attribution Map

## Purpose
This appendix defines **how financial outcomes are attributed to specific funnels**. It prevents ambiguous revenue interpretation, over-crediting activity, and misaligned optimization by clearly mapping results back to the systems that produced them.

This is an **attribution and governance artifact**, not a performance scoreboard.

---

## Attribution Principles

- Revenue is attributed to **originating funnels**, not last-touch activities
- Attribution favors **decision influence**, not visibility
- Quality of conversion outweighs quantity of activity
- Attribution is reviewed, not continuously recalculated

---

## Canonical Funnels

All revenue must be attributed to one of the following:

1. **Buyer Funnel**
2. **Seller Funnel**
3. **Geographic / Local Presence Funnel**

If attribution is unclear, it defaults to **Geographic / Local Presence**.

## KPI → Funnel Attribution Table

### Closed Transactions

| KPI | Attribution Logic | Governance Use |
|----|------------------|----------------|
| Buyer-side closings | Buyer Funnel | Buyer leverage alignment |
| Seller-side closings | Seller Funnel | Seller pricing discipline |
| Mixed or referral closings | Geographic / Local Presence | Brand and trust durability |

---

### Gross Commission Income (GCI)

| KPI | Attribution Logic | Governance Use |
|----|------------------|----------------|
| Buyer GCI | Buyer Funnel | Demand-side health |
| Seller GCI | Seller Funnel | Inventory-side strength |
| Blended GCI | Geographic / Local Presence | Market trust indicator |

---

### Consultation Pipeline

| KPI | Attribution Logic | Governance Use |
|----|------------------|----------------|
| Buyer consultations | Buyer Funnel | Future buyer-side revenue |
| Seller consultations | Seller Funnel | Future listing pipeline |
| Unclear / soft inquiries | Geographic / Local Presence | Nurture effectiveness |

---

### Conversion Quality

| KPI | Attribution Logic | Governance Use |
|----|------------------|----------------|
| High-fit conversions | Originating funnel | Funnel integrity |
| Low-fit or strained conversions | Flag originating funnel | Misalignment signal |

---

## Market-State Sensitivity

Attribution interpretation adjusts based on market state (see B2):

- Buyer-heavy revenue in buyer-leverage markets = expected
- Seller-heavy revenue in seller-leverage markets = expected
- Misalignment between market state and revenue source = review trigger

---

## Anti-Pattern Safeguards

This map explicitly prevents:
- Crediting social posts for downstream referrals without evidence
- Over-optimizing funnels based on short-term revenue spikes
- Mistaking geographic familiarity for marketing performance
- Treating financial KPIs as leading indicators

---

## Review Cadence

- Reviewed during **Monthly Financial Reviews** (C7)
- Interpreted during **Quarterly Growth Reviews** (A6)
- Structural changes only during governance windows

---

## Governance Notes

- Attribution is directional, not precise
- Patterns over time matter more than individual deals
- Attribution supports **decision restraint**, not justification

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If revenue attribution becomes unclear,  
**funnel focus narrows rather than expands**.
