# Appendix C1 — SOP Map

## Purpose
The SOP Map provides a **single visual and conceptual index** of all Standard Operating Procedures governing this business. It clarifies ownership, sequencing, and dependencies across daily execution, client service, marketing, and governance.

This map is a **navigation and control artifact**, not a procedure itself.

---

## SOP Design Principles

- SOPs exist to reduce cognitive load, not eliminate judgment
- Repeatability is prioritized over optimization
- SOPs are reviewed, not continuously edited
- Governance beats improvisation
- Fewer SOPs, executed consistently, outperform complex systems

## SOP Dependency Logic

- Strategic SOPs override all others

- Client Experience SOPs override volume or speed considerations
- No SOP may be bypassed for urgency without review

---

## SOP Review Cadence

- **Monthly:** Light effectiveness review
- **Quarterly:** Structural alignment review
- **Annual:** Consolidation and pruning only

SOP changes are governed, not reactive.

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If an SOP adds complexity without reducing risk or load,  
the SOP is removed or simplified.
