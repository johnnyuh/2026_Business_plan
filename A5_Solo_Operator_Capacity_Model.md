# Appendix A5 — Solo-Operator Capacity Model (Qualitative)

## Purpose
This model defines the **practical capacity limits** of a solo-operator real estate practice. It exists to prevent overextension, preserve decision quality, and ensure that growth decisions remain aligned with human constraints—not theoretical productivity.

This is a **qualitative model by design**. It governs judgment, not math.

---

## Core Assumption

This business is operated by **one person** who is simultaneously:
- The strategist
- The marketer
- The advisor
- The executor
- The quality control layer

Capacity is therefore constrained by **cognitive load, context switching, and emotional energy**, not hours alone.

---

## Capacity Domains

Solo-operator capacity is evaluated across **five domains**. All must remain healthy.

---

### 1. Cognitive Capacity

**What it governs**
- Decision quality
- Judgment under uncertainty
- Advisory clarity

**Healthy indicators**
- Clear prioritization
- Calm consultations
- Confident, unhurried decision framing

**Warning signs**
- Second-guessing routine decisions
- Difficulty synthesizing market inputs
- Increased mental fatigue late in the day

**Implication**
When cognitive load rises, **quality degrades before output**. This is the earliest and most important signal.

---

### 2. Temporal Capacity (Time)

**What it governs**
- Execution reliability
- Responsiveness
- Cadence adherence

**Healthy indicators**
- Daily and weekly schedules are followed
- Buffers remain intact
- No chronic spillover into recovery time

**Warning signs**
- Repeated schedule overruns
- “Temporary” overtime becoming normal
- Backlog formation

**Implication**
Time strain is often **downstream** of other capacity failures, not the root cause.

---

### 3. Emotional & Relational Capacity

**What it governs**
- Client rapport
- Conflict navigation
- Advisory presence

**Healthy indicators**
- Patience in difficult conversations
- Emotional neutrality under pressure
- Consistent professional tone

**Warning signs**
- Irritability or rushed tone
- Avoidance of difficult conversations
- Emotional carryover between clients

**Implication**
When emotional capacity is strained, **trust erosion accelerates**.

---

### 4. Operational Capacity

**What it governs**
- Process discipline
- Error prevention
- Predictability

**Healthy indicators**
- SOPs followed without shortcuts
- Files and systems kept current
- Minimal rework

**Warning signs**
- Skipped steps
- Increased corrections
- Documentation lag

**Implication**
Operational drift compounds silently until it becomes visible to clients.

---

### 5. Recovery & Sustainability Capacity

**What it governs**
- Longevity
- Resilience
- Burnout prevention

**Healthy indicators**
- Protected personal time honored
- Regular physical activity maintained
- Mental decompression present

**Warning signs**
- Skipped workouts
- Encroachment on evenings/weekends
- Chronic fatigue

**Implication**
Recovery erosion is **non-negotiable**. Once compromised, rollback is required.

---

## Capacity Interaction Rule

Capacity domains **fail asymmetrically**.

- Cognitive strain appears before time strain
- Emotional strain appears before operational errors
- Recovery loss amplifies all other failures

Therefore, capacity is assessed holistically, not by a single metric.

---

## Capacity Evaluation Cadence

Capacity is assessed:
- Informally **daily** (self-awareness)
- Formally **weekly** (C4 checklist)
- Governed **monthly and quarterly** (Growth Gates)

Any sustained warning signal triggers a **growth pause** (see Appendix A4).

---

## Strategic Constraint

This model assumes:
- No delegation buffer
- No managerial offloading
- No role redundancy

Any growth that requires relief from these assumptions is **out of scope**.

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If maintaining advisory quality requires more capacity than is available,  
**capacity wins — growth stops**.
