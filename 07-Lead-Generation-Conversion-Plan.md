Lead Conversion Structure Ideas
A. Lead Intake Process
Every new lead enters a structured conversion path:
1. 3. 4. Immediate response within 5 minutes (or automation through MoxiWorks).
2. Qualification within 24 hours.
Add to CRM with assigned tags and follow-up sequences.
Deliver a personalized “welcome touch” (video, market insight, or neighborhood info).
B. Follow-Up Cadence
A hybrid approach using automation + personal touches:
- First 7 days: 3 phone attempts, 3 texts, 2 emails.
- First 30 days: Weekly value-based touches (market insights, neighborhood guides,
Substack posts).
- Long-term nurture: Monthly Prospect Square newsletter + quarterly Denver Forecast
Report.
C. Conversion Metrics
Conversion focus:
- 10% increase in SOI engagement.
- 20% increase in seller opportunities.
- Consistent 3 listings per quarter.
- Maintain 1 qualified buyer client in active pipeline monthly.
- 24–48 hour response times for warm leads.
