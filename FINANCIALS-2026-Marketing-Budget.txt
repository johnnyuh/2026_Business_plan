AI, assume my 2026 marketing budget is $6,000–$8,000.  
(Suitable for lean but consistent farming: postcards, digital ads, events, AI tools.)

Allocate this across:

- Direct mail (monthly + seasonal)
- Listing Concierge packages
- Community events
- Digital content (Substack, social planning)
- Sphere/database touchpoints
- Print materials
- Prospect Square campaigns

I want my budget weighted toward seller attraction in my farm.
