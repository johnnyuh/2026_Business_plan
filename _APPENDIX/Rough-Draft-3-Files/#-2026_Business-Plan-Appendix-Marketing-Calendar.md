# Appendix — Marketing Calendar (Draft v1)

## Purpose of This Calendar
The Marketing Calendar operationalizes the Lead Generation & Conversion strategy by defining **what is published, where, when, and why**.  
It prioritizes **consistency, reuse, and funnel alignment** over volume.

This calendar is governed by:
- Funnel Architecture
- SOP Map
- Growth Gate constraints
- Monthly and Quarterly Review Cadence
