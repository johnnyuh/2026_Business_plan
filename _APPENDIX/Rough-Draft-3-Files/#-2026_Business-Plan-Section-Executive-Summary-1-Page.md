## 2026 Sales Projections (Base Case)
The 2026 plan is built on a conservative, capacity-aligned projection appropriate for a solo operator.

- **Total Transactions:** 12 closed sides  
  - 6 seller transactions  
  - 6 buyer transactions  
- **Average Sale Price:** $600,000  
- **Total Sales Volume:** $7.2M  

**Commission Assumptions:**
- Buyer-side commission: 2.8%  
- Seller-side commission: 3.2%  

**Projected Gross Commission Income (GCI):**
- Buyer GCI: $100,800  
- Seller GCI: $115,200  
- **Total Projected GCI:** $216,000  

These projections are designed to be repeatable and defensible, not stretch targets.

## Lead Generation & Conversion
Lead generation and conversion are governed by a small number of standardized funnels designed to handle multiple lead sources without operational fragmentation. The objective is predictable conversion behavior rather than maximum lead volume.

---

## Client Experience
Client experience is managed as a system, with defined touchpoints and quality standards from first contact through post-close follow-up. Trust, clarity, and professionalism are treated as core business assets.

---

## Financial & Risk Posture
The business emphasizes financial stability, predictable cash flow, and disciplined reinvestment. Solo-operator risk and market variability are explicitly acknowledged. Growth beyond the stated projections is conditional and gated by performance consistency.

---

## 2026 Outlook
Success in 2026 is defined by achieving the 12-transaction base case while maintaining operational control, experience quality, and strategic optionality.
