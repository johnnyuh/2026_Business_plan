# Appendix E5 — Cross-Section Dependency Map

## Purpose
This map documents **how major sections of the business plan depend on and constrain one another**. It ensures that no section is interpreted in isolation and prevents localized optimization from undermining system-wide integrity.

This is a **systems-governance artifact**, not a narrative explanation.

---

## Core Dependency Principle

No section operates independently.

Changes in one area **must be evaluated for downstream impact** across:
- Capacity
- Client experience
- Governance
- Financial interpretation

---

## Primary Section Dependencies

### Market Analysis → Funnel Strategy
- Market interpretation (Section 4) directly determines:
  - Funnel emphasis (Appendix B2)
  - Content themes (B4, B5)
- Misreading market conditions propagates into:
  - Misaligned messaging
  - Poor consultation quality

---

### Funnel Strategy → Operating Cadence
- Funnel emphasis determines:
  - Prospecting intensity (C3)
  - Content production focus (B3, B4)
- Overexpansion in funnels without cadence adjustment leads to:
  - Capacity compression
  - Experience drift

---

### Operating Cadence → Capacity Model
- Daily and weekly schedules (C3, C4) consume:
  - Cognitive
  - Temporal
  - Emotional capacity (A5)
- Cadence violations surface early capacity risk signals

---

### Capacity Model → Growth Eligibility
- Capacity health (A5) is a prerequisite for:
  - Growth Gate passage (A3)
  - Growth authorization (A6)
- Ignoring capacity invalidates growth decisions

---

### Client Experience → Reputation & Referrals
- Experience integrity (D1–D4) drives:
  - Referral quality
  - Long-term trust
- Experience failures compound silently before affecting revenue

---

### Financial Performance → Governance Interpretation
- Financial results (E1, E2) are interpreted through:
  - Market state (B2)
  - Scenario posture (E3)
  - Capacity signals (A5)
- Revenue does not override constraints

---

### Governance → All Sections
- Governance artifacts (A2–A6) have override authority
- Growth, scope, and cadence decisions cascade across:
  - Funnels
  - SOPs
  - Experience
  - Financial posture

---

## Change Impact Matrix (Reference)

| If This Changes… | Then Review… |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Market conditions | B2, B4/B5, C3 |
| Funnel emphasis | C3/C4, A5, D1 |
| Operating cadence | A5, D1–D4 |
| Capacity signals | A3, A4, A6 |
| Experience issues | D2, D3, C2 |
| Financial anomalies | C7, E2, E3 |
| Governance rules | Entire system |

---

## Usage Rules

- No section is edited without:
  - Identifying dependencies
  - Evaluating downstream effects
- Changes are made **slowly and intentionally**
- Emergency changes still require retrospective review

---

## Governance Notes

- This map is referenced during:
  - Quarterly Growth Reviews
  - Annual Plan Revisions
  - Major system changes
- It prevents fragmentation and siloed thinking

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If a proposed change improves one area while weakening another,  
the change is rejected or redesigned.
