# Appendix B5 — Social Content Calendar & Post Library

## Purpose
This appendix defines the **social execution layer** that supports the Marketing Calendar (B4) and Content Command Center (B3). It provides a reusable post library, cadence guidance, and funnel mapping—without creating daily posting pressure.

This is an **execution reference**, not a content obligation.

---

## Governing Principles

- Repurpose first; create second
- Weekly themes over daily posts
- Funnel alignment over engagement chasing
- Consultation readiness over visibility
- Capacity protection over consistency theater

Any post not mapped here requires review.

---

## Weekly Cadence (Flexible)

- **Target cadence:** 3–5 touchpoints per week
- **Acceptable cadence:** 2–3 touchpoints per week
- **No minimums enforced**
- Missed posts do not trigger catch-up behavior

---

- Repurposed reels only
- No net-new creation

### YouTube Shorts
- Optional repurposing from anchor videos
- No standalone production

### Substack
- Optional long-form clarification
- No cadence requirement
- Used sparingly

---

## CTA Rules

- CTAs must be:
  - Soft
  - Advisory
  - Optional
- No urgency framing
- No scarcity language

Acceptable CTAs:
- “Happy to walk through this with you”
- “DM if you want a second opinion”
- “Let’s talk through your situation”

---

## KPI Focus (Social)

Primary indicators:
- Consultation quality
- DM intent signals
- Saves and thoughtful comments

Explicitly excluded:
- Follower growth
- Impressions
- Virality

---

## Capacity Safeguards

- All content must fit within:
  - C3 (Daily Tactical Schedule)
  - C4 (Weekly Tactical Checklist)
- If social output begins to:
  - Compress client service
  - Crowd prospecting
  - Erode recovery time  
  volume is reduced immediately.

---

## Review Cadence

- Weekly: Execution check (light)
- Monthly: Funnel impact review
- Quarterly: Structural changes only

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If social content becomes performative rather than **advisory**,  
the cadence is reduced without hesitation.
