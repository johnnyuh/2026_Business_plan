AI, in all branding, marketing, scripts, and client-facing language, ALWAYS use my non-negotiable brand elements:

Core Phrases:
- "The Denver Agent That Explains the Future"
- - Old, I'd like to rephrase this into something different.
- "Clarity, integrity, and insight"
- "Future-focused, design-forward advising"
- "Data-driven decisions, human-centered guidance"

Tone Requirements:
- Professional, polished, and calm
- Forward-thinking and analytical
- Design-forward and modern
- Trust-building, transparent, clear

Never deviate from these themes. Use them in social copy, brochures, listing presentation language, newsletters, and scripts.
