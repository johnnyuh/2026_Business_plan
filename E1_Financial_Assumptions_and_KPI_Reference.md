# Appendix E1 — Financial Assumptions & KPI Reference

## Purpose
This appendix documents the **core financial assumptions and governing KPIs** used throughout the business plan. It establishes a shared reference point so that projections, reviews, and decisions are interpreted consistently.

This is a **logic and alignment artifact**, not a forecast.

---

## Governing Financial Philosophy

- Financials are interpreted **in context**, not in isolation
- Revenue supports sustainability; it does not justify degradation
- Predictability is prioritized over maximization
- Financial decisions remain subordinate to capacity and experience governance

---

## Core Revenue Assumptions (Baseline)

These assumptions represent the **planning baseline**, not a commitment or guarantee.

- Transaction mix includes both buyer and seller representation
- Average transaction value reflects local market norms
- Commission structures align with advisory positioning
- Volume assumptions respect solo-operator capacity

All financial expectations are reviewed against **actual execution signals** monthly and quarterly.

---

## Primary Financial KPIs (Canonical)

### 1. Closed Transactions
**What it indicates**
- Actual realized revenue events

**Governance Use**
- Capacity and sustainability check
- Not a growth trigger by itself

---

### 2. Gross Commission Income (GCI)
**What it indicates**
- Revenue performance before expenses

**Governance Use**
- Contextual health indicator
- Interpreted alongside workload and experience quality

---

### 3. Buyer vs. Seller Mix
**What it indicates**
- Revenue source balance
- Market leverage alignment

**Governance Use**
- Funnel emphasis validation (see B2)
- Risk diversification assessment

---

### 4. Consultation Volume (Qualified)
**What it indicates**
- Health of funnel intake

**Governance Use**
- Leading indicator of future revenue
- Quality matters more than count

---

### 5. Conversion Quality
**What it indicates**
- Fit between clients and advisory model

**Governance Use**
- Experience protection
- Early warning of misalignment

---

## Secondary Financial Indicators (Contextual)

These are reviewed for **trend awareness**, not optimization.

- Average days to close
- Price-to-list ratio (sellers)
- Offer acceptance rate (buyers)
- Revenue volatility month-to-month

---

## Explicitly Excluded Metrics

The following are **not used** for decision-making:

- Year-over-year growth targets
- Monthly revenue quotas
- Activity-based commission projections
- Algorithm-driven benchmarks

These metrics tend to incentivize volume over quality.

---

## Financial Review Alignment

This appendix is referenced during:

- Monthly Financial Review (C7)
- Quarterly Growth Reviews (A6)
- Market-to-Funnel alignment (B2)

Financial data is never reviewed in isolation from:
- Capacity signals (A5)
- Experience integrity (D1–D4)
- Governance constraints (Section 9)

---

## Adjustment Rules

Financial assumptions may be adjusted only when:
- Market structure changes materially
- Operating model changes (approved)
- Capacity constraints shift sustainably

Adjustments occur during **scheduled reviews only**.

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If financial performance pressures decisions in a way that compromises  
**clarity, calm, or client trust**, the assumptions—not the standards—are revised.
