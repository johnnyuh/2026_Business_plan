## My Ideas to Give to AI

- Quarterly Cool Postcards to My Farm areas that I've Designed. QR-code on card is neighborhood-specific, and links to a custom neighborhood landing page which offers updated stats about the neighborhood, neighborhood specific YouTube Videos.

- Custom door hangers provided during my Farm Neighborhood walks or rides. Door hangers have a neighborhood specific QR-code which links to either:
  - a custom neighborhood website landing page which offers updated stats about the neighborhood, neighborhood specific YouTube Videos.
  - a custom Substack newsletter for local residents.
  - Vet: how do I get visitors contact info in the process?

- Custom business-card like market report to hand out to my farm or anyone. Links to either:
  - a signature "forecast card" that I hand out like a business card. Tarot design.
  - a custom Substack newsletter for local residents.
  - a custom neighborhood website landing page which offers updated stats about the neighborhood, neighborhood specific YouTube Videos.

- Casual conversation turns into a lead.

- I set-up a table outside my office by Le Peep during their weekend busy morning rush and offer:
- - A custom report "What is my home worth?"
- - A link to a neighborhood-specific landing page which offers updated stats about the neighborhood.

- My Social Content gets a lead.

- I cross-reference my farm's owner's names with social media accounts and market to them on social networks.
- - Market how?

- I get a referral lead from my Sphere




## Content Strategy
 
Substack
Market analysis, trend interpretation, “future market” guidance. Substack posts automatically are sent as newsletters to any followers, and the Substack post is also duplicated to LinkedIn.
 
Social Networks
Listings, design-forward visuals, micro market breakdowns, short-form videos, long-form-videos, text posts.
