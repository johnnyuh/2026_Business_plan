## Random Notes
OH GAWD SO MUCH RISK updated to test Git.
Stubborn, Sometimes Argumentative - views ‘debate’ as sport when others may not have the same
belief. 
Sometimes Unfocused - I jump from 1 mental ‘playground’ to another, sometimes before
one is fully developed. 
Can be non-committal. 
May struggle with routine tasks.
Observations: reframe routine tasks or automate them.
