# Appendix A3 — Growth Gate Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist defines the **mandatory conditions** that must be satisfied before any increase in activity, scope, or volume is authorized. It operationalizes the Growth & Scalability Framework and functions as a **hard governance gate**, not a planning aid.

If any item below is not clearly satisfied, **growth is blocked by default**.

---

## How This Checklist Is Used

- Reviewed **only during Quarterly Growth Reviews**
- Completed in full before any growth decision
- Evaluated conservatively
- Documented and archived after each review

This checklist is not used reactively or mid-quarter.

---

## Gate 1 — Capacity & Sustainability

All items must be true:

- ☐ Daily Tactical Schedule (C3) is being followed without chronic spillover  
- ☐ Weekly Tactical Checklist (C4) is consistently completed  
- ☐ No sustained backlog in client communication or deliverables  
- ☐ Recovery time (evenings, workouts, personal blocks) is being honored  
- ☐ No signs of cumulative fatigue or burnout  

**Failing any item blocks growth.**

---

## Gate 2 — Client Experience Integrity

All items must be true:

- ☐ Client communication remains timely and calm  
- ☐ Advisory depth has not been compressed to accommodate volume  
- ☐ Expectations are being set clearly and early  
- ☐ No increase in reactive or corrective conversations  
- ☐ No decline in post-transaction satisfaction signals  

**Experience compression blocks growth.**

---

## Gate 3 — Execution & Process Discipline

All items must be true:

- ☐ Core SOPs are followed without shortcuts  
- ☐ Deal execution timelines are predictable  
- ☐ Errors or rework have not increased  
- ☐ File management and documentation are current  
- ☐ No “temporary exceptions” have become permanent  

**Process drift blocks growth.**

---

## Gate 4 — Funnel & Lead Quality

All items must be true:

- ☐ Lead sources remain aligned with canonical funnels  
- ☐ Consultations are qualified, not volume-driven  
- ☐ Conversion quality has not declined  
- ☐ No increase in unqualified or misaligned inquiries  
- ☐ Marketing cadence is sustainable within batching rules  

**Lead quality degradation blocks growth.**

---

## Gate 5 — Governance Signals

All items must be true:

- ☐ Monthly reviews have been completed consistently  
- ☐ No unresolved issues were deferred across reviews  
- ☐ Growth discussions are proactive, not reactive  
- ☐ Pause conditions (Appendix A4) are not present  
- ☐ Growth intent aligns with Section 9 (Constraints & Non-Goals)  

**Governance failure blocks growth.**

---

## Growth Decision Outcomes

After completing all gates, only one outcome is permitted:

- ☐ **Proceed** — Single-axis growth authorized  
- ☐ **Pause** — No growth; maintain current state  
- ☐ **Rollback** — Reduce scope or volume immediately  

No partial approvals. No conditional approvals.

---

## Documentation Requirement

Each Growth Gate review must record:
- Date of review  
- Gate pass/fail status  
- Decision outcome  
- Any rollback or pause actions  

This record becomes part of the governance archive.

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Growth is a **privilege earned through stability**, not a reward for momentum.

If there is doubt, the correct decision is **pause**.
