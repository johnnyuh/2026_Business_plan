# Appendix D2 — Client Touchpoint → SOP Cross-Reference

## Purpose
This table maps **every major client-facing touchpoint** to the governing SOP(s). It ensures that client experience is **systematically protected**, not left to memory or improvisation.

This artifact is used for **diagnosis and correction**, not daily execution.

## How This Table Is Used

- Referenced during:
  - Weekly Reviews (C6)
  - Experience issue diagnosis
  - Quarterly Experience Reviews (D4)
- Used to trace experience failures back to process gaps
- Not used as a live checklist

## Diagnostic Use Case

When a client issue occurs:
1. Identify the touchpoint where friction emerged
2. Reference the governing SOP
3. Determine whether:
   - SOP was not followed
   - SOP is insufficient
   - Capacity constraint interfered
4. Route findings to:
   - SOP refinement (C2)
   - Capacity review (A5)
   - Experience review (D4)

---

## Governance Notes

- SOP adherence is assumed unless proven otherwise
- Repeated failures indicate system issues, not individual mistakes
- Corrections occur at the **process level**, not ad hoc

---

## Executive Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If a client experience issue occurs twice,  
the system—not the situation—is at fault.
